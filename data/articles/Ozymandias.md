# Ozymandias: The Inevitable Fall of Power

Percy Bysshe Shelley’s *Ozymandias* is a haunting meditation on power, legacy, and the passage of time. Written in 1818 during the Romantic period, the poem explores how even the greatest rulers and empires eventually crumble into obscurity.

The poem begins with a traveler describing a ruined statue in the desert. The shattered remains—“two vast and trunkless legs of stone” and a “shattered visage”—once belonged to a powerful king named Ozymandias. Despite the inscription on the pedestal that reads “Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!”, there are no visible works left. Only the endless sands remain.

Shelley’s use of irony is central to the poem’s impact. The proud boast of Ozymandias stands in stark contrast to the emptiness that surrounds the statue. This irony highlights the futility of human ambition and the fleeting nature of power. No matter how mighty a ruler may seem, time will eventually erase their legacy.

The poem’s imagery is vivid and symbolic. The “wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command” etched into the statue's face conveys the arrogance and cruelty of the ruler. Yet even that expression has been worn away by time, reinforcing the idea that nature and history are more enduring than any individual’s ego.

*Ozymandias* also reflects the Romantic era's fascination with ruins, the sublime, and the limits of human achievement. Shelley uses the statue not just to criticize tyranny, but to remind us that all human creations are impermanent.

In just 14 lines, Shelley delivers a powerful message: all empires fall, and all pride is ultimately humbled. The poem is a timeless warning against hubris, and a reminder of the enduring forces beyond our control.
